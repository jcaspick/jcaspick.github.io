<p>Here's a screen recording of the demo in action. Other than the hovercar which I modeled and textured by hand, everything you see is procedurally generated.</p>

<p>And here is footage of a few different tracks being generated from an aerial view so you can get a better idea of what the world looks like.</p>

<h1 id="backstory">Backstory</h1>
<p>I first started learning Unity sometime in 2015. After making a few rudimentary games by following tutorials, the first <em>real</em> project I started was a racing game called Ruedehue with procedurally generated tracks. Some footage of an early version of the game can be found <a href="https://vimeo.com/159261981">on Vimeo</a>. I was playing a lot of Mario Kart 64 at the time and the aesthetics of the game were very much inspired by Rainbow Road. I remember noticing how well that track had aged compared to the others in the game. The clean and minimal design is relatively unhindered by the hardware limitations of the N64 and it has that certain retro-computer-graphics charm that never fails to trigger nostalgia.</p>
<p>Unfortunately I never finished the project. I spent the majority of the time writing the procedural track generator which was loads of fun. Then when it came to making the actual <em>game</em> my motivation started to falter. I kept inventing ways to <em>not</em> work on the gameplay and to make things like a procedurally generated cityscape instead.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Years later I decided to revisit the project. I still didn't have the time or motivation to make a full-fledged racing game, but the procedural tracks and cityscapes were too cool not to do <em>something</em> with. I had been learning OpenGL at the time and I got the idea to rewrite the racetrack and city generator from Ruedehue, ditch the interactivity, and just make a demo. With a filesize of a whopping <strong>1MB</strong> it's not quite a <em>true</em> demoscene prod (nor was that my intention). I consider it an homage to the demosceners that inspired my love of computer graphics. While the graphics are simple and retro-looking, I did experiment with a couple of more &ldquo;advanced&rdquo; graphical effects. There is a subtle bloom applied to the city lights and tail lights of the car, and the car is made shiny looking with real-time reflections.</p>
<p>Overall this project was lots of fun to make! Revisiting and rewriting my old code with new knowledge was a neat learning experience that I'd highly recommend trying. Many days I still feel like a complete beginner and it was nice to be reminded of how much progress I've actually made. It's also quite amusing to see some of the hacky solutions I came up with before I knew a better way of doing things. For example, I must have gotten frustrated trying to wrap my head around Unity's quaternion rotations at the time. My track generator didn't apply actual rotation transforms to anything. Instead I had an <em>angle</em> variable attached to each segment of the road and used trig functions to transform the verts of the mesh at creation time.</p>
<h1 id="source-code-and-executable">Source code and executable</h1>
<p>The source code can be found <a href="https://github.com/jcaspick/vaporous">on github</a>. It is in the form of a Visual Studio project. I have successfully compiled it on Windows 7 and 10 using Visual Studio 2017.</p>
<p>A pre-compiled 32-bit windows binary is <a href="https://github.com/jcaspick/vaporous/releases/tag/0.0.1">also on github</a> for anyone interested in running the demo without building it from source.</p>
<p>The program was written in C++ and has minimal dependencies. I use GLFW to get a window and an OpenGL context, GLAD as my OpenGL loading library, and GLM for math. I also included the wonderful ImGUI library for building the debug menu.</p>
<h2 id="controls">Controls</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>R</strong> generates a new track</li>
<li><strong>C</strong> switches to a new randomly chosen camera angle</li>
<li><strong>~</strong> opens the debug menu where you can customize track generator parameters, camera angles, and some other stuff</li>
</ul>

<p>The cityscape was heavily inspired by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-d2-PtK4F6Y">this video</a>. I remember stumbling upon it many years ago and having my mind blown. It may have actually been my first exposure to the idea of a procedurally generated 3D world. <a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
