<h1 id="the-game">The Game</h1>
<p>Mattorium is a game about managing an assembly line that produces exotic subatomic particles. The mechanics of the game are simple: particles travel through a series of one-directional tubes and you click on <em>switchers</em> to determine which path they take at intersections. Particles come in six colors and can be stuck together in clusters of up to three. Each level contains various machines which are used to mix colors, fuse particles together into clusters, and break them apart. Perform these basic operations in the correct sequence to create X amount of a specific goal particle to complete each level.</p>
<p>As the levels get more complex you&rsquo;ll find yourself having to multi-task and pay attention to many moving particles at different stages of construction in different parts of the level. One wrong move and you could end up creating <em>unstable particles</em>, a waste product that must be disposed of ASAP. Luckily you also have the ability to manipulate the speed of the particles. You can work slowly and carefully, or risk catastrophe to try and get the best level times.</p>
<p>The mechanics of the game were inspired by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URqyNdAdEz0">Factory</a>, a brilliant little Mac shareware game that I played in my childhood. If you&rsquo;re interested in hearing me talk about the game design and inspiration in more detail I recorded this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUrdUvgl11I">dev diary video</a> midway through the project.</p>

<h1 id="the-backstory">The Backstory</h1>
<p>Like many people who make games as a hobby I have a bad habit of starting projects and not finishing them. Game development is time consuming and even a relatively simple game idea can end up taking months or even years of work. Some of the work is a lot of fun but an equally large portion of it is tedious and motivation-killing.</p>
<p>I have a lot of fun at game jams because they&rsquo;re almost the precise opposite of a typical hobby project: an unreasonably tight deadline instead of a loose floaty one, surrounded by creative people instead of at home struggling to focus. They&rsquo;re the perfect mildly-chaotic environment for getting something finished. Not perfect, not polished, but finished! I leave every game jam feeling inspired and wondering why I don&rsquo;t approach all my projects like this. I imagine how much I would get done and how much more <em>fun</em> I would have with this hobby if I could just bring some of that energy home with me.</p>
<p>In early April, finding myself confined to my apartment with unprecedented amounts of free time during the Covid 19 lockdown, I decided to finally put that idea to the test. The development of Mattorium was guided by the philosophy: <strong>fast is best</strong>. I kept the scope of the game small, and resisted the urge to spend time polishing any small details. I focused the majority of my effort on the core gameplay loop and the level design. I was able to finish the game in under three months. It&rsquo;s not perfect, and it&rsquo;s not polished, but it&rsquo;s finished!</p>
<p>This project was lots of fun to work on, and I consider a successful experiment in productivity. I intend to approach all my future game development projects in the same way. Even a much more complex project would benefit from starting with a quick prototype of the core features.</p>
