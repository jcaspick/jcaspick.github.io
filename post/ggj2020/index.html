    <section class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links nested-img mid-gray pr4-l"><p>At this years Global Game Jam I was part of a team of five that was roughly divided into two programmers and three artists/game designers (see the bottom of this post for credits and links to their socials.) It was a great experience and I'm proud of the game we built together. What follows is a little post mortem of my experience.</p>
<h1 id="what-we-made">What we made</h1>
<p>The theme of the jam this year was &ldquo;Repair&rdquo;, which may be my favorite theme of any game jam I've been to. It can be interpreted in so many different ways that are rich with gameplay ideas. When brainstorming game ideas I like to think in terms of two separate but interconnected categories: the theme and the mechanics. The most interesting game ideas to me are ones where there is a sort of feedback loop in which the theme informs the mechanics and vice versa.</p>
<p>During our group brainstorm we ended up on the topic of neurons and how thoughts and memories are formed in the brain. The act of trying to remember something could be loosely thought of as &ldquo;repairing&rdquo; connections between neurons. As for game mechanics, I started to imagine a game world made up of an interconnected grid of brain cells with signals travelling between them. Another one of my teammates suggested that a puzzle game would be a good fit for this concept and we all agreed.</p>
<p>The game we came up with is entitled Mind Mend. You can find it <a href="https://globalgamejam.org/2020/games/mind-mend-9">on the GGJ website here</a>. And here is some gameplay footage:</p>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">

</div>

<p>The game mechanics are reminiscent of the classic computer game Snake. The goal of the game is to guide two different colored &ldquo;signals&rdquo; through a sequence of goal nodes of the corresponding color. This is done by drawing connections between the nodes. Each connection lasts for a certain number of turns before dissapating, and functions as both a pathway for it's like-colored signal, and an obstacle for the opposite colored one. Each time a goal node is reached, the connections grow stronger making the board more difficult to navigate. The game is lose when either of the two signals is cornered and no legal move can be made. The artists on our team created a series of illustrations that reveal a loose story about one character losing their phone, and another finding and returning it. Each time a goal is reached one of these illustrations briefly appears suggesting that some important pattern of neurons was just activated and the brain has recalled a fragment of memory.</p>
<h1 id="what-i-learned">What I learned</h1>
<p>My role on our team was programming the game mechanics while Lukas, our second programmer, worked more closely with the artists to create the visual effects. My goal was for us to be able to work in parallel as much as possible. I learned that the best way to achieve this is to structure the game code in such a way that the logic is completely decoupled from the graphics. I did most of my development with some simple placeholder graphics and the idea was to create a simple API for communicating the game state to &ldquo;view&rdquo; objects which can display that state however they choose. The logical objects do not know or care what the view objects do with their state. They could be moving a simple sprite, or managing some arbitrarily complex particle effect. It's similar in essence to the model-view paradigm in the UI programming world.</p>
<p>Of course, with Game Jam being what it is, the execution of this idea fell a little short of the pristine architecture I had envisioned. A couple of hours were lost trying to transition smoothly from the placeholder graphics to the finished assets. My biggest mistake was trying to save time by having the logic objects do double-duty rendering the placeholder graphics. I should've taken the extra time to set up the logic-graphics separation from the very beginning. Overall though, I'm happy with how this approach worked and would definitely try using it again in future projects.</p>
<p>My proudest accomplishment however was creating a working level editor for our game.</p>
<p><img src="/images/ggj2020/level_editor.png" alt="Mind Mend level editor"></p>
<p>Creating development tools is one of my favorite parts of any project. I get immense satisfaction from automating tedious tasks and removing friction from peoples&rsquo; workflows. Our team was spread across two small adjacent offices at our jam site, and the most rewarding experience of the entire weekend was hearing two of the artists excitedly talking about level ideas that they were testing with the editor. Empowering non-programmers to create content for a game is immensely valuable. Good design always requires a lot of trial and error, nothing ever works exactly how you imagine it will in the planning phase. It's more effective, and more fun for everyone if the designers can experiment and make tweaks to the game quickly and easily without needing a new build from us programmers every time they want to try something.</p>
<p>Overall this was a fantastic learning experience for me. I consider myself a perfectionist in recovery, and there is no better exercise than Game Jam for getting me out of my comfort zone of overthinking small details.</p>
