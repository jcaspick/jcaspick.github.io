    <section class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links nested-img mid-gray pr4-l"><p>I've finally solved my intersecting track problem. My first solution involved generating the road in multiple passes. First the generator would do a &ldquo;flat pass&rdquo; and lay out road segments on the same plane, freely overlapping. Then it would identify points where the track overlapped and cache some information about those points for the &ldquo;height pass&rdquo; which would add hills and valleys to the road while paying special attention to the intersection points and keeping the overlapping sections separated by a minimum clearance value.</p>
<p>It was overly complicated and didn't work.</p>
<p>So I tried a different solution which is almost the exact opposite: generate the track piece-by-piece evaluating each step and proceeding only if the path is clear. To accomplish this I used recursively nested coroutines, allowing a certain number of &ldquo;tries&rdquo; at each step before backtracking to a previous one. I enjoy solving problems with recursion and had a lot of fun writing this algorithm. Here's a video of the new track generator in action, I find it quite satisfying to watch.</p>
