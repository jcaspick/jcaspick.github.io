        <p>I&rsquo;m a programmer, technical artist, and general computer graphics nerd. My driving passion in life is to never stop learning. I&rsquo;m the sort of person who cycles through many different hobbies/interests/obsessions, but the ones I&rsquo;ve consistently come back to throughout my life are computer graphics and programming. I&rsquo;ve been exploring the twin worlds of graphics and code ever since I was a kid using ResEdit and a primitive 3D program called Mechanisto to add my own ships to the classic Mac game <em>Escape Velocity</em>.</p>
<p>I began my career as a 3D artist in the training and simulation industry. I had been learning how to code in my spare time, doing hobby projects in Unity 3D, and experimenting with VR headsets. I was able to find ways of applying these new skills at work and eventually grew into my current niche as a technical artist, a job that nicely accommodates my interest in both software and graphics. A lot of my work is on so-called &ldquo;serious game design.&rdquo; I use the same tools and technologies as a video game developer for the purposes of training and education. Another major part of my job is developing custom tools to solve project-specific problems, improve workflows, and help the 3D artists on my team be more productive and less miserable by automating tedious tasks.</p>
<p>On this website you&rsquo;ll find blog posts about whatever topics I&rsquo;m currently fascinated with as well as a portfolio of some of my personal projects.</p>
